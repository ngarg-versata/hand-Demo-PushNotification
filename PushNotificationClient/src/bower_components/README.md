### Dojo ###

The core covers a wide range of functionality like AJAX, DOM manipulation, class-type programming, events, promises, data stores, drag-and-drop and internationalization libraries.

### Dijit ###

An extensive set of widgets (user interface components) and the underlying system to support them. It is built fully on-top of the Dojo core.

### Dojox ###

A collection of packages and modules that provide a vast array of functionality that are built upon both the Dojo core and Dijit. Packages and modules contained in DojoX will have varying degrees of maturity, denoted within the README files of each package. Some of the modules are extremely mature and some are highly experimental.

### Util ###
